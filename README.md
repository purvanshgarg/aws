# AWS Projects

#### These were guided projects done while attending aws training.

#### In S3, I hosted a static website on s3 bucket.

#### In RDS, I used boto3 to connect to s3 bucket and pymysql to create a table then I converted the table to csv format and uploaded it to s3 using boto3.

#### In EC2, I hosted a static website on ec2.

#### All the necessary steps have been mentioned in pdfs that are present in repository.

#### There is also a ipynb file that helps in all the connection and uploading process for rds using python.

#### pdfs need to be downloaded first to be viewd properly as github does not support pdf preview.
